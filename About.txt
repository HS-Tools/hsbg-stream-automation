Plugin for making predictions on twitch and running ads after HSBG games end

Setup:
1. User downloads the plugin
2. User configures the plugin with their twitch client id, client secret, and oauth token
3. User configures ad time and prediction types
4. User toggles the plugin on in the Hearthstone Deck Tracker plugin menu

Normal flow:
1. User starts a HSBG game
2. Plugin checks onGameStart for hero name and starts prediction based on config
3. OnGameEnd, plugin gets placement
4. Plugin resolves prediction and runs ad

Reference:
I have created a HDT plugin before and attached it.
I have also created a python script to do automatic predictions but it doesn't use HDT logic
Twitch Integration has been done on python in twitch_integration.py and main.py. We can use this logic here too
Examples of how to implement placement/hero name logic can be found in ReferenceHDT.cs

Phase 1:
1. Use static variables for twitch config in .env file
2. OnGameStart, get hero name and start prediction based on config
